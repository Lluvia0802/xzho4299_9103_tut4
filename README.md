## Individual Task
### Random Seed (perlin noise): Utilise random numbers or perlin noise for animation.
### Description
I designed an interactive digital poster for an exhibition of Pacita Abad's artwork. I mainly used the circle element extracted from his work ***Wheels of Fortune*** as the main element of the poster (the fireworks in the Group Task). I used Berlin noise to modify the speed and size of the fireworks and added the animation of meteors streaking in the background to give the poster a visual impact. Users can randomly obtain electronic posters of different styles, enter their names, and save them as their unique exhibition posters as souvenirs.

### Instructions
1. Press the space bar to change the firework style, firework color, and poster color.
2. Click on the upper left corner of the window to enter your name (when the mouse changes to input mode), the name will be displayed on the poster.
3. If the delete key is pressed, you can remove the last character to modify your name.
4. When the mouse position is within the poster range, click the mouse to save the poster as image file
